A collection of useful (custom and file-exchange) scripts, toolboxes and such.
Licenses, readmes, and any other info for files obtained from other internet
sources are included.


Custom Scripts
--------------

Functions and scripts written either in lab, or downloaded from the
file-exchange (may or may not be modified). Files that were selected as the
file-exchange's Pick Of The Week (potw) have an included `potw.txt` file with
the URL to the relevant post.

* `textprogressbar`
    * creates a text progress bar
* `parseEEGFile`
    * reads EEG files generated my MJs machine
* `taylorApprox`
    * carries out a taylor approx to some function
* `arrow3`
    * draws arrow heads on lines
* `boundedline`
    * allows you to plot lines with shaded bounds, that can represent error or confidence bounds.
* `createColorHistograms`
    * creates color histograms
* `exportFig`
    * set of functions to export matlab figures to different types
* `grep`
    * find anything!!
* `legendflex`
    * create a much more flexible legend!
* `mtit`
    * easily adds a title to a group of subplots
* `notifier`
    * emails you when your script/program finishes running
* `panel`
    * allows for easier paneling of figures

* `extrema`
    * finds the local/global max/min, returning their location and value
* `logsumexp`
    * high accuracy version of log sum exp that avoids numerican underflow
* `tprod`
    * Multi-dimensional generalization of matrix multiplication
* `linspecer`
    * Better colors for matlab
